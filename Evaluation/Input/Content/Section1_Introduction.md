The presented PBPK model of ethinylestradiol (EE) has been developed to be used in a PBPK Drug-Drug-Interactions (DDI) network with ethinylestradiol as perpetrator of CYP1A2.

Ethinylestradiol is an estrogen medication which is used widely as a birth control pills in combination with progestins. The following ADME properties characterize ethinylestradiol ([SmPC Namuscla](#5-references), [FDA. QUARTETTE](#5-references)):

**Absorption**: ethinylestradiol is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gut but it undergoes some first pass metabolism in the gut wall (mediated by a.o. CYP3A4 ([Wiesinger 2015](#5-references), [Wang 2004](#5-references))). After oral administration, an initial peak occurs in plasma at 2 to 3 hours, with a secondary peak at about 12 hours after dosing; the second peak is interpreted as evidence for extensive enterohepatic circulation of ethinylestradiol.

**Distribution**: ethinylestradiol is rapidly distributed throughout most body tissues with the largest concentration found in adipose tissue. It distributes into breast milk, with low concentrations. More than 80% of ethinylestradiol in serum is conjugated as sulphate and almost all the conjugated form is bound to albumin.

**Metabolism**: ethinylestradiol is metabolised in the liver. Hydroxylation appears to be the main metabolic pathway. 60% of a dose is excreted in the urine and 40% in the faeces. 

**Excretion**: About 30% is excreted in the urine and bile as the glucuronide or sulphate conjugate. The rate of metabolism of ethinylestradiol is affected by several factors, including enzyme-inducing agents, antibiotics, and cigarette smoking. The elimination half-life of ethinylestradiol ranges from 5 to 16 hours.

After i.v administration, ethinylestradiol displays approximately linear dose relationship in the dose range 30-100 µg. A wide variability is present in the terminal part of the dose-normalized concentrations.

After p.o. single dose, ethinylestradiol shows linear dose relationship in the dose range 30-3000 µg. Secondary peaks can be observed in individual data, compatible with enterohepatic re-circulation. However, mean data do not display such feature as a result of such peak being averaged out. Therefore, enterohepatic re-circulation was not taken into account in the model.
